# Fairness benchmark execution

This directory contains a jupyter notebook for each mitigation technique that is evaluated. 
The notebooks were only used to test the mitigation approaches during development and may contain old or wrong code/outputs. 
The final experiments were executed using the terminal and the python scripts.
